## Controls

- Moving Start/End Nodes: Click on the current node location, then click again on the desired location
- Creating walls: Holding the spacebar while hovering over an empty node will convert it to a wall (You can hold the spacebar and use your mouse as a brush to make chains of walls)
- Running the simulation: Pressing the return/enter key will run the visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm
- Deleting a wall: Holding the backspace or delete key while hovering over a wall will convert it to an empty node
- Clearing the board: Pressing the escape key will clear all walls and any previous path visualizations
